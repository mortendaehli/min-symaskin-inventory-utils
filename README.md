# min-symaskin-inventory-utils

Here you will find a few code snippets that I have utilized while working at [Min Symaskin](https://www.minsymaskin.no). 

This is a shameless SEO effort on behalf of my webstore. I'm happy to answer questions if you have some.

### Info
- I only have single variant of each item for now. This may change in the future.
- The setting of inventory quantity is a bit confusing when starting out. I hope this script is of some help to others

### Hot to use:
1. Create .env file based on the sample.env
2. Install requirements.txt in python 3.8 (I have not checked backward compat, but it should be okay or easy to fix. pathlib I think is new)
3. Put your inventory file in ./data/inventory.xlsx - see inventory-sample.xlsx for example. Mine is in Norway. Pleae modify according to your need.
