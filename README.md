# My Shopify Inventory Utils

Here you will find a few code snippets that I have utilized while working at [Min Symaskin](https://www.minsymaskin.no)
and [Quiltefryd](https://www.quiltefryd.no). 

I'm happy to answer questions if you have some.

### Info
- I only have single variant of each item for now. This may change in the future.
- The setting of inventory quantity is a bit confusing when starting out. I hope this script is of some help to others
- I am does some migration jobs, data scraping etc. Maybe this is useful for others...

### How to use:
1. Install poetry, docker(optional) and pre-commit(optional)
2. Have fun!
